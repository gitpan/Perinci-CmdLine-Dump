NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine::Dump - Run a Perinci::CmdLine-based script but only to
    dump the object

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of Perinci::CmdLine::Dump (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-CmdLine-Dump), released on 2014-12-21.

FUNCTIONS
  dump_perinci_cmdline_script(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Run a Perinci::CmdLine-based script but only to dump the object.

    This function runs a CLI script that uses "Perinci::CmdLine" (or its
    variant "Perinci::CmdLine::Lite" or "Perinci::CmdLine::Any") but
    monkey-patches "Perinci::CmdLine::Base" beforehand so that "run()" will
    dump the object and then exit. The goal is to get the object without
    actually running the script.

    This can be used to gather information about the script and then
    generate documentation about it (e.g. "Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Rinci" to
    insert POD sections based on information from the Rinci metadata of the
    function used by the script) or do other things (e.g. "App::shcompgen"
    to generate a completion script for the original script).

    CLI script needs to use "Perinci::CmdLine". This is detected currently
    by a simple regex. If script is not detected as using
    "Perinci::CmdLine", status 412 is returned.

    Will return the "Perinci::CmdLine" object dump. In addition to that, if
    detected that script refers to function URL "/main" (which might mean
    that function metadata is embedded in the script itself and not in a
    separate module), will also dump the target function's metadata in
    "func.meta" in this function's result metadata.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filename* => *str*

        Path to the script.

    *   libs => *array*

        Libraries to unshift to @INC when running script.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)
